#You've just finished writing a new feature for ourwebsite. We want to roll 
#switch the client to the green route with new feature gradually. We will first divert 25% 
#of the client to green. After some time we will divert 50% and 75%. At the end we will 
#finally switch the entire traffic ie. 100% to green.
#Let us assume â€“
    #1. Blue is the current version or the N version of the code
    #2. Green is the version with new feature or N1 version of the code

##Create a keyval zone that will help to change the canary percentage using 

keyval_zone zone=split:64k state=/etc/nginx/state_files/split.json;
keyval $server_name $split_level zone=split;

    blue75_green25 $split_blue75_green25;

}

#be assigned either Blue or Green upstream
